        <h1>Braeden Lhamon presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
            <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
                Come, follow, this way follow with thy darkened steps,<br>
                Father, the way I am leading thee.</p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
                Content thee, sojourning in a strange land,<br>
                O man of woe!<br>
                To eschew whateâ€™er the city holds in hate,<br>
                And honour what she loves!</p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
                <span class="in14">Then do thou lead me, child,</span><br>
                Where with our feet secure from sin<br>
                We may be suffered both to speak and hear.<br>
                Let us not war against necessity.</p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
                There! From that bench of rock<br>
                Go not again astray.</p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
                Even here?</p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
                <span class="in10">Enough, I tell thee.</span></p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
                <span class="in24">May I sit?</span></p>
                <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
                Ay, crouch thee low adown<br>
                Crooking thy limbs, upon the stone.</p>
