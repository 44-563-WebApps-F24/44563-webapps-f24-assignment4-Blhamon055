        <h1>Braeden Lhamon presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
            <h3>ANT.</h3>
                <p>Come, follow, this way follow with thy darkened steps,<br>
                Father, the way I am leading thee.</p>
            <h3>CH.</h3>
                <p>Content thee, sojourning in a strange land,<br>
                O man of woe!<br>
                To eschew whateâ€™er the city holds in hate,<br>
                And honour what she loves!</p>
            <h3>OED.</h3>
                <p>do thou lead me, child,<br>
                Where with our feet secure from sin<br>
                We may be suffered both to speak and hear.<br>
                Let us not war against necessity.</p>
            <h3>CH.</h3>
                <p>There! From that bench of rock<br>
                Go not again astray.</p>
            <h3>OED.</h3>
                <p>Even here?</p>
            <h3>CH.</h3>
                <p>Enough, I tell thee.</p>
            <h3>OED.</h3>
                <p>May I sit?</p>
            <h3>CH.</h3>
                <p>Ay, crouch thee low adown<br>
                Crooking thy limbs, upon the stone.</p>
